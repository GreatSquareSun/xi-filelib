# Xi Filelib

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/xi-project/xi-filelib.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/xi-project/xi-filelib)

Filelib is a file library component for PHP, providing a virtual filesystem for your web application's files.
It can be used to manage both your application's internal and user-uploaded files in many ways. What it (at least for now)
is NOT is a place to store your assets like css, js and similar.

Let's face it: practically all web apps have to store documents, media and such and the needs are same.
Filelib takes care of all the hard and/or repetetive tasks and abstracts away and reveals all the related changeable
components as loosely coupled subsystems:

* Storing of metadata (virtual folders / files) in a data storage (database, usually).
* Safe physical storage of files in a filesystem (local, S3, Gridfs, etc).
* Authorization (who can do what in the virtual filesystem) and publication (to make them fast-readable and with
  pretty urls) of world readable files.
* Rendering the files to HTTP response (sometimes you can't world-publish everything but it's still gotta be decent).
* Mime types and extensions and all this horrible stuff
* Versioning (meaning creation of different representations of a master file, thumbnails, html5 videos etc)
* Asynchronous processing (you can't keep the end user waiting for that video to be encoded, you know)
* And there's probably more!

Filelib is fully extensible via plugins and hooks. In fact, many of the "core" functionality is provided
via plugins (authorization, automatic publishing, file versions) so the core is kept elegant and maintainable.

Filelib is based on my own observations, opinions and experience formed while developing many
file- and mediabanks for the last 10 years. It has evolved and keeps evolving with real projects and use cases,
so thanks for all past and present early adopters!

## Hard requirements

- A client software that needs file management
- PHP 5.3.x
- Json support for a poor poor man's data storage

## Soft requirements (for harder use)

- A serious data storage (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB supported out of the box)
- Imagemagick for image processing
- Zencoder for all your video needs
- Intl for transliterating / slugifying
- A queue (RabbitMQ, IronMQ, SQS) for asynchronous operations

## Quickstart

### Using JSON storage (for simple testing only)

```php
<?php

use Xi\Filelib\FileLibrary;
use Xi\Filelib\Backend\Platform\JsonPlatform;
use Xi\Filelib\Storage\FilesystemStorage;
use Xi\Filelib\Storage\Filesystem\DirectoryIdCalculator\TimeDirectoryIdCalculator;

$filelib = new FileLibrary(
    new FilesystemStorage(__DIR__ . '/files', new TimeDirectoryIdCalculator()),
    new JsonPlatform(__DIR__ . '/filelib-example.json')
);

$file = $filelib->upload('/path/to/some/file.jpg');

// Display the image
header("Content-Type: " . $file->getMimetype());
echo file_get_contents($filelib->getStorage()->retrieve($file->getResource()));

```

### Examples and use cases

Í„`docs/examples/index.php` contains a lot of coded examples. Checkout the code, configure a web server and dive
straight into the code.

## About integrating to your own software

Experience has time and again proved that integration should be as light as possible. If one is using Doctrine ORM,
it could seem appropriate to integrate via Filelib's entities. DON'T. It will bite you back. Just save Filelib
ids / uids within your own data and use Filelib for everything else.

## Framework integration

For framework integration, see:

* https://github.com/xi-project/xi-bundle-filelib (Symfony bundle, needs a maintainer, I'm a very bad one!)
* https://github.com/xi-project/xi-bundle-filelib (Symfony sandbox, needs a maintainer too!)

## Actual applications using Filelib

For actual applications I know are using Filelib, see:

* http://autot.oikotie.fi: Classified ads for cars. Ancient version if not upgraded without my knowledge / help.
* https://oy.eautokoulu.fi: Learning environment. Advanced large-scale usage of both images and videos. Current version.
* http://sykettatyohon.fi: Document / image managent provided by probably a somewhat older version.

Know more? Please tell!
